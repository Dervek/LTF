                    Hey beautiful, my most beloved, my most precious and most valued.
We've only been together for a month and few days, but it feels like I've known you for so many years, maybe I have, or maybe this isn't my first time being with you, might sound crazy but what if I'm rightüòÇ. <br>
I wanna tell you something, something special, something only you would ever hear from me. <br>
Fave, I don't think I'll ever live a day without you, don't think I'll ever be the same without you, you've become a big part of me that I truly need. <br>
<br>
Before I met you I've been messed up pretty bad, I've been hurt, hurt by so many, so ever since then I've got insecurities, Fave I'm scared, scared I would one day loose you, when I love someone, I love with all my heart, I love in such a way that I'm ready to risk anything for the one I love, and that person is you. <br>
<br>
Once again I wanna say i'm sorry, sorry for what I did on the 29th of march, I honestly can't believe I was the one who actually hurt you, so I wanna make a promise to you, and trust me I hardly make promises, but for you I would. <br>
<br>
I promise to never again hurt you the way I did, promise to always care for you, promise to always be there for you when ever you need me, and no matter how much we quarrel, I will never leave. <br>
<br>
I've seen how much you truly love me and I was mistaken to ever doubt you. I want you to know this few things, it's not fully possible for us to live without quarreling, its gonna come but when it does we shouldn't let it get into our minds so much that we forget who we mean to each other, what we should do is solve the issue, cause truly you mean alot to me. <br>
<br>
Fave, you beautiful, you kind, your practically everything anyone could ever wish for, and I'm so glad I get to be loved by you. <br>
So I'm saying Thank you for bringing light into my life. <br>
<br>
Never forget, I care about you, so so much. <br>
<br>
I LOVE YOU Babe.
